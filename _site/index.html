<p>In 2003 Games Workshop published the fourth edition of their science fiction, mass combat system: Epic Armageddon. The game relied heavily on community feedback during its development and a living rulebook was made available for free via <abbr title="Games Workshop">GW</abbr>'s Fanatic Games Division website. While the rules are still available for free to this day, they do not see active development from <abbr title="Games Workshop">GW</abbr> with Fanatic being closed. Instead, development flows from the fans in the form of Net Epic Armageddon.</p>

<h2>What is <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr>?</h2>

<p><abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> (Net Epic Armageddon) is a community that continues to support and develop Epic Armageddon. It incorporates the official Epic Armageddon rules without modification, and builds on top of the rules by providing clarifications and updated army lists (many not included in the original publication).</p>

<p>This website serves as an information base for new players and houses our bigger projects, but all development for <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> lives on the <a href="http://taccmd.tacticalwargames.net/">Tactical Command forums</a>. If you're interested in contributing then head on over to the forums, we're always looking for gamers who want to expand the game and hobby, as well as provide playtest feedback.</p>
