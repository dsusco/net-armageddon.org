<h2>NetEA Tournament Pack</h2>

<p>The <a href="//tp.net-armageddon.org/"><abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> Tournament Pack</a> goes back to the idea of a living rulebook when Epic was seeing active development from Games Workshop's Fanatic division. It contains:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>official</strong> Epic Armageddon game rules and <strong>all</strong> of the errata. All is stressed here as some errata are missing from the rulebook <abbr>PDF</abbr> that <abbr title="Games Workshop">GW</abbr> published.</li>
  <li>The most up-to-date <abbr>FAQ</abbr> available, essentially an expanded version of the last <abbr>FAQ</abbr> published by Games Workshop. Each Q&amp;A is a footnote in the appropriate section of the rules.</li>
	<li>All of the <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> approved army lists as well as any rule extensions and Q&amp;A's that accompany them. <abbr title="Net Epic Armageddon">NetEA</abbr> approved army lists are tournament ready and balanced against one another using the Epic tournament game rules. These lists vary slightly (point-cost and unit-stat-wise) from the official lists due to community feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official Rules</h2>

<p>In addition to the original printed forms of the rulebook and Swordwind supplement, Epic's official rules were made available for free by Games Workshop and occasionally updated with errata (the printed books were never updated). However these <abbr>PDF</abbr>s were removed when the website was updated in 2014. They can now be downloaded here. Here's a breakdown on what each <abbr>PDF</abbr> contains:</p>
